# Trivial Pursuit: Matt Edition

## Game Description
This game is a ten question multiple choice trivia game.

## User Experience
### MVP Goals
<ol>
<li>When the screen loads, the game is ready to play with the first question already displayed</li>
<li>The user will then read the question text presented to them on the screen, and select from one of the four multiple choice answers</li>
<li>Once an answer has been selected, a message will pop up above the scoreboard indicating if the asnwer was correct or incorrect</li>
<li>At this same time, the scoreboard above the question text will update. If the answer is correct, both numbers will be incrmeent by one. If the answer is incorrect, only the number to the right of the 'out of' text will update.</li>
</ol>

### Stretch Goals
I plan to add additional styling to this page once the MVP is completed.
