## Game Description
This game is a ten question multiple choice trivia game.

## User Experience
### MVP Goals
<ol>
<li>When the screen loads, the game is ready to play with the first question already displayed</li>
<li>The user will then read the question text presented to them on the screen, and select from one of the four multiple choice answers</li>
<li>Once an answer has been selected, a message will pop up above the scoreboard indicating if the asnwer was correct or incorrect</li>
<li>At this same time, the scoreboard above the question text will update. If the answer is correct, both numbers will be incrmeent by one. If the answer is incorrect, only the number to the right of the 'out of' text will update.</li>
<li>The user will then click the next question button below the answers</li>
<li>The game will continue in that fashion until all ten questions have been answered by the user</li>
<li>Once the final question has been answered, the screen will change to show your final score and a message will pop up indicating the game has concluded</li>
</ol>

### Stretch Goals
I plan to add additional styling to this page once the MVP is completed.
